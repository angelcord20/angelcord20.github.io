What you are looking at right now it was supposed to be christmas themed, basically a model of a tree but somehow it ended up being kind of an abstract figure, that lowkey looks like the green lantern symbol with snow particles.
I ridiculously took way too much time doing such thing but if you put a lofi-hiphop and stared at the snow falling through the inside of the shape you'll feel really calm, I highly recommended.
