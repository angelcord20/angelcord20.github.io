    <h1>If I pursue a career it would either be programming or business</h1>
    <p>Sorry to say this, but what I hate the most is having someone on top of me telling what to do and when to. I don't like have that kind of pressure on me, so at some point I will feel really overwhelmed and end up quiting everything and being nobody. I want to be my own boss lol. In other words wrong answer!</p>
